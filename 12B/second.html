<h1>Horus and his rise and fall</h1>
<p>The naked version of the lore of the everchosen who fell to the darkness of the stars</p>

  <div class="col">Eventually, the Imperial Warmaster Horus fell to the temptations of the Ruinous Powers of Chaos and attempted to destroy the Imperium from within by usurping the power of the Emperor.
    The treason of Horus, known in later centuries as the Horus Heresy, spread to embrace approximately half of the Imperium's military forces, including small Planetary Defence Forces, many regiments of the Imperial Army, the 9 Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legions and several of the Adeptus Mechanicus' potent Titans, forming the core of dark Mechanicum Adepts who chose to serve the Ruinous Powers and were later called the Dark Mechanicus.
    The terrible civil war lasted for 7 standard years and culminated in a massive seige of the Imperial Palace during the climactic Battle of Terra. After 55 days of fighting, the war was ended by the Emperor of Mankind and Horus dueling in single combat aboard Horus' flagship, the Battle Barge Vengeful Spirit, in orbit of Terra, before futher Loyalist reinforcements could reach the world and throw the Traitor forces back from their prize. <br/>
    Although mortally wounded during the final battle with his favoured son, who had become swollen and immensely powerful with the favour of the Chaos Gods, the Emperor was able to strike down Horus using the full gathered might of his awesome psychic powers and obliterate Horus' soul from the Warp, preventing him from being resurrected to serve the Ruinous Powers once more. 
    <p>Without their leader, the unity of the Forces of Chaos soon crumbled and as Loyalist reinforcements led by Roboute Guilliman of the Ultramarines arrived in the Solar System, the Chaos Space Marine Legions and their allies retreated to the massive Warp rift in the Segmentum Obscurus known as the Eye of Terror.<br/>
     At his own direction, the crippled body of the Emperor was installed into the cybernetic life support mechanisms of the psychic amplifier known as the Golden Throne, so that his mind would continue to have an anchor in realspace from which his potent mind in the Warp could battle the influence of the Chaos Gods and continue to direct the Astronomican, the psychic beacon that was the lifeblood of the Imperium's communications, commerce and interstellar travel.</p>
 
 <p>Effects of a small battle of the Heresy on the Planet of Sotha drew the attentions of the Hive Fleets of the Tyranids to the galaxy, It was during these days, that they started moving towards this new prey.</p> 
 
 <H2>The Great Scouring </H2>
 
 <p>The Great Scouring, or simply The Scouring, was the Imperium of Man's great counter-offensive against the Traitor Legions. It began immediately after the end of the Horus Heresy following the death of the Warmaster Horus and the failure of his Siege of the Imperial Palace during the Battle of Terra in the early 31st Millennium. It succeeded in driving the Forces of Chaos from Imperial space into finding a refuge in the permanent Warp Storm known as the Eye of Terror.
    Before actually being confined for all time within the life support mechanisms of the Golden Throne, the Emperor had pronounced judgment on the Traitors: he declared them Excommunicate Traitoris, and determined that they were to be driven into the hellish region of the Warp rift called the Eye of Terror, which would hold them for all eternity. All records and memory of the Traitor Legions were to be expunged from the Imperial archives.<br/>
     Worlds such as Istvaan V and Davin would be scoured clean of all life because of their corruption by Chaos. <br/>
    The Traitor Legions' associated troops from the Dark Mechanicus, the Titan Legions or the regiments and starships of the Imperial Army and Imperial Navy that had turned to Chaos were to be destroyed or driven into the Eye. It would be as if the Traitor Legions had never existed to sully the Imperium with their betrayal. After the death of Horus, those Traitors who had not been slain outright during the Siege of the Imperial Palace fled before the vengeful wrath of the Loyalist forces.
     Many made good their escape into unexplored space or disappeared into the Eye of Terror or other, lesser-known Warp rifts such as the Maelstrom.<br/>
    Fighting continued for another seven standard years after the Heresy had ended with Horus' death on the bridge of his great flagship, the Vengeful Spirit, before the Traitor forces were wholly destroyed or exiled into the Eye of Terror. Many Chaos-corrupted star systems were cleansed and placed under the watch of the newborn Inquisition. The Emperor's dream of a new age of enlightenment, a time when Mankind was freed from superstition and ignorance, would turn into something far different.
     The Great Scouring would be followed by the ten millennia long era known as the Age of the Imperium. </p>
