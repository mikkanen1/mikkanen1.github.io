    <div class="col">Warhammer 40,000 is a miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop. It is the most popular miniature wargame in the world, particularly in the United Kingdom. The first edition of the rulebook was published in September 1987, and the ninth and current edition was released in July 2020.

      As in other miniature wargames, players enact battles using miniature models of warriors and fighting vehicles. The playing area is a tabletop model of a battlefield, comprising models of buildings, hills, trees, and other terrain features. Each player takes turns to move their model warriors around the battlefield and pretend that they are fighting their opponent's warriors. These imaginary fights are resolved using dice and simple arithmetic.
      
      Warhammer 40,000 is set in the distant future, where a stagnant human civilisation is beset by hostile aliens and supernatural creatures. The models in the game are a mixture of humans, aliens, and supernatural monsters, wielding futuristic weaponry and supernatural powers. The fictional setting of the game has been developed through a large body of novels, published by Black Library (Games Workshop's publishing division).
      
      Warhammer 40,000 has spawned a number of spin-off tabletop games. These include Space Hulk, which is about combat within the narrow corridors of derelict spacecraft, and Battlefleet Gothic which simulates spaceship combat. Video game spin-offs, such as the Dawn of War series, have been released. </p>
